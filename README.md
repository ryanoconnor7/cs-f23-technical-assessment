# Hi!

Welcome to my code sample, an **interactive calendar date picker**.

You can select dates and move back and forth between months as you'd expect, but there are some neat additional features.

## Additional Feature #1: Swipe Between Months on Mobile

It's as simple as that! Use a left or right swipe gesture on the calendar to change months on devices that are narrower than 450px.

## Additional Feature #2: Jump to Month on Desktop

Non-mobile devices will be able to use a drop-down to quickly change to a month within the same year! Simply click on the Month in the date picker.

## Credits

This project only uses a few packages to help:

- `styled-components` for better organization of stylesheets in React
- `lodash` for some quick data utils
- `moment` for modern date utils
- `gh-pages` for deployment on GitHub
